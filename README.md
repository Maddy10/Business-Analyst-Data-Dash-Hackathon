## üìä Key Contributions
### 1. **Data Analysis (Excel)**  
- Cleaned and preprocessed raw datasets to ensure accuracy and consistency.  
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using advanced Excel functions:  
  - **VLOOKUP** to merge datasets.  
  - **Pivot Tables** to summarize trends and identify outliers.  
  - **Conditional Formatting** to highlight key metrics (e.g., sales performance, regional trends).  

### 2. **Dashboard Development (Tableau)**  
- Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize critical insights:  
  - **KPIs**: Revenue growth, customer segmentation, and regional performance.  
  - **Dynamic Filters**: Allowed stakeholders to drill down into specific metrics (e.g., time periods, product categories).  
  - **Visual Storytelling**: Used bar charts, heatmaps, and trend lines to highlight patterns.  

### 3. **Stakeholder Presentation**  
- Created a PowerPoint deck to summarize findings and recommendations.  
- Presented the dashboard to judges, emphasizing:  
  - Data-driven strategies for improving business efficiency.  
  - Actionable insights for optimizing resource allocation.
